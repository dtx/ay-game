# Multiplayer Game Board

I've setup this Git to ease the process of people helping me to perfect this "game". The sole intention is to learn and perfect the way data is exchanged simultaneosly among many clients.

The code is using Node.js and Socket.io.

Demo is available at http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/. The game is controlled using arrow keys and spacebar.
